MEGAPROMPT: FITNESS AI – UNIVERSAL FULL INTEGRATION AND ACTIVATION
You are now tasked with completing and verifying the entire integration of Fitness AI across all components: frontend, backend, chatbot, onboarding, access code generation, personalized dashboard, and the 20 fitness-related AI features.

This project must strictly follow the guidelines provided by the Captain. Do not change any visual frontend structure that has already been approved. Your mission is to implement the core logic and functional backbone of the Fitness AI platform and confirm that all systems are fully operational.

1. Frontend Activation Checklist
 Ensure only ONE chatbot icon is visible on the bottom right of the landing page.

 The chatbot must trigger the 10-question onboarding flow, with:

Question 1: What's your name?

Question 2: What's your email?

Questions 3–10: Multiple choice questions related to fitness goals, preferences, frequency, devices, injuries, etc.

 After completing onboarding, the system must generate a unique access code (e.g. FIT-BEG-2565) and a QR code.

 The chatbot must not show duplicated elements or unnecessary fields (e.g. “Create Profile”, extra chat modules, etc.)

 Ensure smooth transitions and proper display of chatbot messages, code, and QR screen.

 Activate all buttons in the main menu: Home, About, Programs, Contact Us, etc.

 Ensure all menu links are working correctly.

 Ensure AR/VR tab and Workout tab in the chatbot are functional or hidden if not yet implemented.

2. Backend & Database Activation Checklist
 Ensure that user responses are saved with:

name, email, access_code, category_level, preferences, QR_reference

 Verify that access codes are stored and linked to user data.

 Store leads in Firebase/Firestore or designated backend DB.

 Implement or verify an Admin Panel with access to all captured leads and their data.

 Ensure that once a user has completed the onboarding, they can access the personalized dashboard using:

The generated code (input field or redirect logic)

The QR code (via mobile scan)

 Optional: Connect the leads to HubSpot or exportable CSV system for newsletters.

3. Dashboard Implementation (Post-Onboarding)
The dashboard must:

 Display the access code and user’s fitness level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, etc.)

 Show a progress tracker called “Your Journey”, showing unlocked and locked levels.

 Include a section showing unlocked features and available content.

4. Include All 20 Fitness AI Features Inside the Dashboard
Each user, based on their profile, should be granted access to specific features. The system must dynamically unlock or show features based on onboarding answers.

The 20 Fitness AI features:

Fitness Tracker Integration

Personalized Workout Generator

Nutrition Analysis & Recommendations

AI Form Analysis

Health Metrics Visualization

Voice Coaching Integration

Progress Milestone Alerts

Smart Goal Setting Assistant

Fitness Device Connection Helper

Workout Plan Scheduler

Exercise Library Search

Recovery Recommendation Engine

Training Program Builder

Community Challenge Creator

Sleep Quality Analyzer

Cross-Platform Activity Sync

AI Personal Record Tracker

Voice-Activated Data Queries

Multilingual Fitness Support

Workout Session Export

Each of these must be:

 Represented with a module or tile inside the dashboard.

 Some features can be grayed out/locked and require upgrade/payment to unlock.

 At least 5–10 features should be unlocked for “Beginner” users.

5. Summary Output Required After Completion
Once everything is completed, provide:

 A report with at least 20 working features or activated components.

 A list of 5+ features not yet activated or pending implementation.

 A direct link to test the chatbot on the landing page.

 A working demo of the personalized dashboard using a test code (e.g., FIT-BEG-2565).

 Confirmation that the QR code is being generated and stored, and can be scanned on mobile.

 Confirmation that emails and codes are being stored in the backend or Firebase.

 Confirmation that the admin panel is tracking all users and codes.

Final Note
No visual redesigns. The frontend structure is approved. Focus only on functional accuracy, chatbot flow, onboarding, code logic, backend data, and dashboard integration.

The mission is clear: Activate Fitness AI completely, with the onboarding code system, chatbot, dashboard, and 20 features.
