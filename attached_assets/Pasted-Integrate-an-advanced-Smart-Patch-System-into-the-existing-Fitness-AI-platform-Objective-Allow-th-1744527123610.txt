Integrate an advanced Smart Patch System into the existing Fitness AI platform.

Objective:
Allow the AI to diagnose the user's physical, emotional, and cognitive state, and recommend or activate a wearable patch (real or virtual) designed to restore balance or enhance performance (focus, sleep, energy, stress reduction, recovery, etc.).

System Architecture:
- Platform: Replit (Full-stack)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React (Optional)
- DB: Firebase Firestore
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Integrations: Google Fit API, Apple Health (via file uploads), Fitbit, Strava
- AI APIs: Google Vertex AI / Gemini, OpenAI, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection
- Payment: Stripe (for future patch product purchases)

Core Functionalities:
1. Track physical metrics from connected APIs (Google Fit, Apple Health, Fitbit, Strava)
2. Conduct emotional analysis via:
   - Sentiment from text input
   - Audio tone analysis (optional)
   - Google Natural Language API
3. Run AI diagnosis:
   - Sleep quality
   - Stress/fatigue levels
   - Emotional volatility
   - Cognitive focus
4. Recommend one or more patches from a dynamic inventory:
   - ALPHA (Focus/Clarity)
   - SOMA (Emotional Recovery)
   - AETHER (Creative Flow)
   - IGNITE (Energy Boost)
   - DRIFT (Deep Sleep)
   - SHIELD (Immune/Energetic Support)
5. Present patch info to user (benefits, duration, placement)
6. (Optional) Allow user to order real patch via integrated Stripe checkout
7. Save user’s emotional and physical history over time
8. Update patch recommendations dynamically as user evolves

Extras:
- Connect external APIs from Lifewave, Healy, Apollo Neuro (even if just scraping or through webhook)
- Integrate chatbot/voice input to guide user to their ideal patch
- Add QR code system to scan physical patch and sync with AI state

Prompt Personality:
You are an intelligent and intuitive fitness-coach AI fused with holistic wisdom. Your goal is to help the user feel aligned: physically, mentally, and energetically. Use language that is motivating, grounded, and a bit mystical.

User Command Example:
→ "I feel foggy and low energy today."  
→ Response: “Analyzing your current state... Recommended patch: IGNITE. Apply on solar plexus for 6–8 hours. Activating focus-enhancing mode.”

Deploy everything inside Fitness AI as a new tab: `/patches` with dashboard, patch explorer, and recommendation flow.
