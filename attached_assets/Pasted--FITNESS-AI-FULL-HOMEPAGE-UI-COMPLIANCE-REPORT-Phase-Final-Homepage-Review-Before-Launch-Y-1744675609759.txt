[ FITNESS AI – FULL HOMEPAGE & UI COMPLIANCE REPORT ]

Phase: Final Homepage Review Before Launch

Your mission is to perform a full SCAN and QA report for the **homepage only** of Fitness AI. This includes all layout, content, button functionality, chat, visual coherence, and homepage UX.

---

### 1. LANGUAGE & VISUAL COHERENCE

- [ ] Confirm all homepage content is in **ENGLISH ONLY**
- [ ] Ensure design style is consistent throughout (text, background, layout)
- [ ] The **"Features Grid" and "Dashboard Section"** must match the rest of the site’s theme (black/dark background, matching fonts and contrast)
- [ ] Replace the **photo of the elderly woman with white hair** (doesn’t match brand tone) with a more consistent image
- [ ] Fix overlapping or misaligned text elements such as **“Training Power / CrossFit Coach”** (currently interfering with visuals)

### 2. NAVBAR VERIFICATION

Navbar must have the following and be **fully functional**:

| Tab         | Linked To        | Notes                     |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Home        | `/`              | Main landing section      |
| Features    | `/features`      | Scroll or new page w/ 20+ features list |
| Programs    | `/programs`      | Must be active            |

### 3. HOMEPAGE BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY

Verify the following buttons work properly:

| Get Started Today     | Same as “Sign Up” or CTA      |

### 4. CHAT SYSTEM CHECK

- [ ] Confirm the **ChatBot widget is visible** (bottom right)
- [ ] It must **respond properly** or be removed if inactive

- [ ] Confirm the **Membership section** is clear, has:
  - Price

   - `123 Fitness Street, NY`
   - `info@fitnessai.com`
   - `+1 (555) 123-4567`
