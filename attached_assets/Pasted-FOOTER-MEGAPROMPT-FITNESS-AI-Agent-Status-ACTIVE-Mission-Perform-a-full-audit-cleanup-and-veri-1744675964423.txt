If the link is #, blank, or placeholder → REMOVE IMMEDIATELY

If accounts don’t exist yet, comment out or remove until real links are available.

2. COLUMN: "PROGRAMS"
Check each listed item:

All Programs

Strength Training

Cardio

HIIT Workouts

Mobility

Requirements:

Each must link to a working section of the app or scroll target.

If a program is not fully built or leads nowhere → REMOVE or mark as coming soon in UI.

Consider replacing static text with dynamic routing for seamless flow.

3. COLUMN: "QUICK LINKS"
Check functionality of:

Features

Login

Sign Up

Contact

Actions:

Each link must be fully functional and direct to the correct screen/component.

If any route is broken or inactive → Fix or remove before launch

4. COLUMN: "CONTACT"
Current values:

Contact Us (link)

24/7 AI-Powered Support

Orders:

Contact Us link must open a valid contact form, support ticket, or email modal

If 24/7 AI-Powered Support is not functional (e.g., if chatbot doesn’t handle support), edit wording or temporarily remove

5. BOTTOM BAR – LEGAL LINKS
Privacy Policy and Terms of Service must point to actual legal documents/pages.

If they don’t exist yet → Replace with a “Coming Soon” modal or disable the links

6. VISUAL CONSISTENCY CHECK
Footer must match the brand palette (green/black/white)

Avoid excessive spacing, broken layout, or visibility issues on mobile

Ensure font size and button styles match global theme

7. FINAL REPORT BACK
Submit a Footer Verification Report with:

✅ All links that are working and connected to real destinations

❌ All elements that were removed or deactivated

⚠️ Any placeholder links still pending implementation

Suggestions for enhancements (e.g., newsletter input box, live support badge, additional quick links)
