## Nutrition Plan for Weight Loss & Muscle Building

### Daily Targets:
- Slight caloric deficit (10-15% below maintenance)
- Protein: 1.6-2g per kg of bodyweight
- Carbs: 3-4g per kg on training days
- Fats: 0.8-1g per kg of bodyweight
- Water: Minimum 3L per day

### Key Strategies:
- Eat protein with every meal (lean meats, eggs, Greek yogurt)
- Time carbs around workouts for better energy and recovery
- Include vegetables in at least 2 meals per day
- Limit processed foods and added sugars
- Consider intermittent fasting (16:8) if it fits your schedule

Would you like me to create a sample meal plan based on these guidelines?`;
